## The `use` form hook

`ReForm.use` is the mainly hook. You're always going to use it to build your forms. It's important to notice that the hook is only available in your form module generated by the [ReForm.Make](/docs/reform-make) functor.

```rescript
module Lenses = %lenses(
  type state = {
   name: string
  }
)

module Form = ReForm.Make(Lenses)

@react.component
let make = () => {
 let form = Form.use(
  ~initialState={ name: "Alonzo Church" },
  ~onSubmit={api => {
    Js.log(api)
    None
  }},
  ~schema={
    open Form.Validation

    schema([string(~min=3, Name)])
    },
  ()
  )

  // Render stuff...
}
```
